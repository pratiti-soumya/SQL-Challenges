- What is the total amount of debt owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt, and what does that amount look like?
- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

## Dataset

- `countries`: Contains information about different countries and their respective continents.
- `international_debt`: Contains information about the amount of debt owed by developing countries in various categories.
